WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ov7076_565_to_332/m3/GND_11_o_GND_11_o_AND_103_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ov7076_565_to_332/m3/GND_11_o_GND_11_o_AND_91_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ov7076_565_to_332/m3/GND_11_o_GND_11_o_MUX_81_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.

   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <inicio_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
DRC detected 0 errors and 7 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
